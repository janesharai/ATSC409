# ATSC409


Here is the code for our final project. The code has both the simple and complex versions of the model in the files, but the code was then copied to be used in individual work files which are named after the person who did the work on that file. 

Our model aims to build a basic 1-D climate model and subsequently add clouds to it to see how that will affect the surface temperatures.

Thanks for checking it out!
